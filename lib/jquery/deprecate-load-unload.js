    JQMIGRATE: jQuery.fn.load() is deprecated
    JQMIGRATE: jQuery.fn.unload() is deprecated
    Cause: The .load() and .unload() event methods attach a "load" and "unload" event, respectively, to an element. They were deprecated in 1.9 and removed in 3.0 to reduce confusion with the AJAX-related .load() method that loads HTML fragments and which has not been deprecated. Note that these two methods are used almost exclusively with a jQuery collection consisting of only the window element. Also note that attaching an "unload" or "beforeunload" event on a window via any means can impact performance on some browsers because it disables the document cache (bfcache). For that reason we strongly advise against it.

    Solution: Change any use of $().load(fn) to $().on("load", fn) and $().unload(fn) to $().on("unload", fn).
