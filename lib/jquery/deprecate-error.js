    JQMIGRATE: jQuery.fn.error() is deprecated
    Cause: The $().error() method was used to attach an "error" event to an element but has been removed in 1.9 to reduce confusion with the $.error() method which is unrelated and has not been deprecated. It also serves to discourage the temptation to use $(window).error() which does not work because window.onerror does not follow standard event handler conventions. The $().error() method was removed in jQuery 3.0.

    Solution: Change any use of $().error(fn) to $().on("error", fn).
